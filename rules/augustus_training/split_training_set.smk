rule split_training_set:
    """
    Split training set into train and test portions for accuracy assessment.

    This rule performs the critical first split that BRAKER does:
    - Creates train.gb.test: held-out test set for final accuracy measurement
    - Creates train.gb.train: training set used for all etraining and optimization

    The test set is NEVER used during training. It's only used to assess
    the accuracy of the trained AUGUSTUS parameters. This ensures an unbiased
    accuracy measurement.

    Test set sizes follow BRAKER logic:
    - < 600 genes: 1/3 of genes
    - 600-1000 genes: 200 genes
    - > 1000 genes: 300 genes

    This is a local rule (runs on head node) because randomSplit.pl is very fast.

    Input:
        gb_input: Clean GenBank file (after etraining filtering, optionally downsampled)

    Output:
        gb_test: Test set for accuracy measurement (never used for training)
        gb_train: Training set (used for all etraining and optimization)
        split_log: Log file documenting the split
